## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- tailwindCSS classes
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- 
### What I learned

This was the first time using redux toolkit, it is really helpful for state management,
although i am yet to see its advantage over the build in Context API, i know that it
is a much bigger deal otherwise it wouldn't be much spoken of, i learned the basics of
it including how to create a slice, configuring the store and a lot more.

I loved the design of this project, so looking at my creation now that i am done feels 
amazing, i also learn't the simple notications library React toastify, it is a helpful
for simpmle notifications.

I also used the useParams hook in this one to grab the currently items in order to display
it on the details page, this is the first time am doing as i am used to using the newly 
released react router dom loader funtions which has the useLoaderData hook which does away
the need for the useParams most times.

Overall this was an amazing challenge and practice and i want to thank the Frontend mentor
team for providing these designs to help developer who are learnin.

### Continued development

A friend of mine said the mobile menu wasn't intuitive, so i plan redoing it and making it a simple design and that is for users to navigate.
